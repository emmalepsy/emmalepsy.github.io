excerpt: In my first whackadoodle, I explain why you can write better if you use less adjectives. 
---
People started subscribing to my email newsletter, so I figured it was time to share something.

So, I've begun writing whackadoodles and sending them to my peeps. A few days later, I'm posting them here.

A whackadoodle is a tip/insight/revelation about writing, which you, as a content marketer, should care about. Yes, I made it up. Donâ€™t you just love the sound? Whack-a-doodle. Whack, whack, DOODLE.

### "Wait, Emma! Why are you qualified to give writing tips?"

- I run [Stories by Emma](http://storiesbyemma.co/), a writing business. Companies hire me to write stuff for them. Business is booming.
- I've worked as a writer at a marketing agency and at a top tier tech company. I once [wrote an article for Buzzfeed](http://storiesbyemma.cmail20.com/t/t-l-dukrkld-kylyhjlht-y/) that got 87,000 views in 24 hours.
- I've written a novel during National Novel Writing Month.
- I studied English language in college and won awards and got honors and stuff.
- Someone told me recently that THE WORLD NEEDED MY VOICE.

## Whackadoodle #1: Oh, adjectives! U sneaky bastards!
Fiction writers--you know, the ones who smoke pipes and teach at university MFA programs--are always on about adjectives.

They tell you that you should be able to describe a pond without relying on adjectives.

- You should use VERBS. Instead of writing about the crystal pond, say that the pond shimmers.
- You should use NOUNS. Instead of writing about the smelly pond, say that the pond is a fish's toilet.

Look at the following two statements, and you'll see how much clearer the writing is without adjectives:

WITH ADJECTIVES: The user-friendly, cloud-based software helped me communicate with my serious accountant, who loves me despite my incessant questions.

WITHOUT ADJECTIVES: The software helped me communicate with my accountant, who loves me despite my questions.

See what I mean?

__Abjectives suck.__ You don't need them. Quit ramming them in. 

I challenge you, content creator, stop relying on adjectives. 

Happy writing & editing. Until next whackadoodle.
