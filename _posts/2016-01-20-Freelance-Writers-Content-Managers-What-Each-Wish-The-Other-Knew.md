Content managers and freelance writers work together all the time, but do they always see eye to eye?

Nope. 

Sometimes freelance writers expect better guidelines from content managers. Other times, content managers expect freelance writers to have a stronger grasp on their brand.

But something magic happens when freelance writers and content managers develop an understanding. Suddenly, high quality work is produced in less time. Suddenly, you have a partner on your content marketing journey.

Join us __Wednesday, January 27th at 1:30 PM PST (3:30 PM CST)__ for a Blab that discusses what freelance writers wish their content managers knew-- and what those content managers wish their freelance writers knew.

In 45 minutes, you’ll learn what obstacles freelance writers and content managers face, as well as how to overcome them. You’ll learn what makes great partnerships between writers and content managers, so you can pursue them yourself.
