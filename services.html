      <h1>We can help you tell your story.</h1>

	  <p>
	    You know that great marketing can do wonders for your business. But
	it’s hard to build a strategy and execute on it.
	  </p>
	    
	  <p>
	    You’re attached to your brand, and you want someone who
	    seamlessly fits into what you’re doing. You want someone
	    who makes your life easier, not harder.
	  </p>

      <h2 class="center">Common questions</h2>
		<p><h3>How do your rates work?</h3></p>

      <p>We charge on a per project basis. That means you pay for the
      valuable marketing assets you get, not the hours that we spent
      creating them. </p>

      <p>We also offer monthly retainers to clients who want
      marketing help on an hourly basis.</p>

      <h3>Do you have a waitlist?</h3>

      <p>Yes. For this reason, we need need three weeks of lead time when
      starting a new project. However, if you need us RIGHT NOW, we can
      make space for you (I charge a 20% rush fee to do so).</p>

      <h3>How do you deal with edits and revisions?</h3>

      <p>For each project, we offer one round of edits and
      revisions. That means that once you receive assets, you
      can go through and make suggestions. Once we receive your
      requests, we make changes. This process
      simplifies things for both of us. You consolidate your
      revisions, and we get you the perfect piece as quickly as
      possible.
     </p>


     <h3>How do you manage your projects?</h3>

     <p>Large projects are fun. They require a lot of planning and
     communication to minimize stress, stay on task, and meet
     deadlines. When we work on a project with a large scope, we divide
     the work into three phases:
     </p>

     <ol>
       <li>
	 <p><b>Planning and research</b> - You share what you need us
          to do. We read up on everything having to do with your
          business and your industry. We also interview you, your team,
          and your customers to get a sense of the subject matter. In
          the planning phase, we present exactly what the project will
          entail.
	 </p>
       </li>
       <li> 
	 <p><b>Execution</b> - We execute on what we’ve agreed
          upon. Execution includes content and copywriting, editing,
          and image sourcing.
	 </p>
       </li>
       <li>
	   <p><b>Revisions</b> - We make revisions and
          changes based on what you want. From there, we’ll assess how
          the project when overall and double-check to make sure
          nothing is leftover.
	   </p>
       </li>
    </ol>

       <p>This three phase process ensures that we deliver exactly what
       you want. We’ll be in touch throughout the process to make sure
       we’re on track.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I get access to your services on demand?</h3>

      <p>If you need consistent help with copywriting, editing, and general marketing consulting, consider a monthly retainer. </p>

      <p>Retainer clients have access to us whenever they need help. This means if you contact us and need something right away, We're there for you. </p>
