	  <p>
	    You know that great marketing can do wonders for your business. But
	    damn, it’s hard to build a strategy, execute on it, and still have
	    time to stuff a sandwich in your mouth at lunchtime.
	  </p>
	    
	  <p>
	    You’re attached to your brand, and you want someone who
	    seamlessly fits into what you’re doing. You want someone
	    who makes your life easier, not harder.
	  </p>


	  <p>
	    <b>That’s where I come in.</b> Whether you need help
	    building a strategy or executing on an existing one, I
	    fill in the gaps.
	  </p>

	  <p>I believe that well-written content is powerful and
	    inspiring. Clients hire me to help with content marketing
	    strategy, blog posts, case studies, web copywriting, and
	    other related activities.
	  </p>

	  <p>When we work together, you’ll find that I strive to be
             knowledgeable and respectful, while being easy-going and
             flexible. And my favorite clients are as well.

      </p>

      <div class="group">

	  <h2 class="holler center"><span class="mega-octicon octicon-star"></span></h2>
	  <h3 class="holler">Content Strategy</h3>

	  <p class="holler small"> I'll help you educate your audience
          with amazing content. I love to write, and have written
          hundreds of blog posts, eBooks, case studies, video scripts,
          websites, and landing pages.
	  </p>

	  <h3 class="holler">Copywriting</h3>
	  <p class="holler small">
           Need help refining your message? I'm your girl. I can help
           with all copywriting needs, from your landing pages, to
           your emails, to your ads, to your social posts.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="c6">
	  <h2 class="holler center"><span class="mega-octicon octicon-puzzle"></span></h2>
	  <h3 class="holler">Consulting</h3>
	  <p class="holler small">
            I take on marketing consulting projects when I think I can
            help. I have experience with SEO, social media, landing page
            optimization, customer interviews, email marketing, and more.
	  </p>
	</div>
      </div>


      <h2 class="center"> À la carte services </h2>

      <p>Need help with a specific project? I offer many services à la
      carte so I can be there when you need me most. My most popular à
      la carte services include:
      </p>

      <ul>
	<li>Blog posts</li>
	<li>eBooks and guides</li>
	<li>Ghostwriting</li>
	<li>Email copy</li>
	<li>Case studies & customer interviews</li>
	<li>General web copywriting</li>
	<li>Proofreading & editing</li>
	<li>In-person workshops</li>
	<li>SEO keyword research</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Note that my minimum engagement rate for a project is $500. </p>

      <h2 class="center">Common questions</h2>
      <h3>How do your rates work?</h3>

      <p>I charge on a per project basis. That means you pay for the
      valuable marketing assets you get, not the hours that I spent
      creating them. My project rates range from $500 - $10,000.  I
      require a 50% deposit when working with new clients. </p>

      <p>Sometimes, an hourly rate makes sense for both of us. If
      we’re working together and the process is iterative (such as
      multiple edits and revisions for a website), I’ll charge an
      hourly rate. I also offer monthly retainers to clients who want
      marketing help on an hourly basis.</p>

      <h3>Do you have a waitlist?</h3>

      <p>Yes. There are lots of people that want the Emma factor. For
      this reason, I usually need three weeks of lead time when
      starting a new project. However, if you need me RIGHT NOW, I can
      make space for you (I charge a 20% rush fee to do so).</p>

      <h3>How do you deal with edits and revisions?</h3>

      <p>For each project, I offer one round of edits and
      revisions. That means that once you receive assets from me, you
      can go through and make suggestions. Once I receive your
      requests, I’ll get to work on making changes. This process
      simplifies things for both of us. You consolidate your
      revisions, and I get you the perfect piece as quickly as
      possible.
     </p>


     <h3>How do you manage large projects?</h3>

     <p>Large projects are fun. They require a lot of planning and
     communication to minimize stress, stay on task, and meet
     deadlines. When I work on a project with a large scope, I divide
     the work into three phases:
     </p>

     <ol>
       <li>
	 <p><b>Planning and research</b> - You share what you need me
          to do. I read up on everything having to do with your
          business and your industry. I also interview you, your team,
          and your customers to get a sense of the subject matter. In
          the planning phase, I present exactly what the project will
          entail.
	 </p>
       </li>
       <li> 
	 <p><b>Execution</b> - I execute on what we’ve agreed
          upon. Execution includes content and copywriting, editing,
          and image sourcing.
	 </p>
       </li>
       <li>
	   <p><b>Revisions</b> - I make revisions and
          changes based on what you want. From there, we’ll assess how
          the project when overall and double-check to make sure
          nothing is leftover.
	   </p>
       </li>
    </ol>

       <p>This three phase process ensures that I deliver exactly what
       you want. We’ll be in touch throughout the process to make sure
       we’re on track.
      </p>

      <h3>Why hire you over another writer?</h3>

      <p>I’m <b>damn good</b> at writing and communicating. Many have told
      me I’m the best. I have my own style, but I’ll get to know
      yours. I can write like Mark Twain or Amy Schumer. I can write
      like you.
      </p>

      <p>I care about quality, and I’m always learning more about
      marketing. I can take complex, technical concepts and make them
      easy to understand. Clients partner with me because they want
      professional writing that feels fresh and fun.
      </p>

      <p>A few things clients have said:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>“Emma was amazing to work with in every aspect.”</li>
	<li>“‘Incredible’ does not begin to describe the quality of Emma’s skills.”</li>
	<li>“Emma is my absolute favorite writer. She GETS us.”</li>
	<li>“Emma's writing is accessible, despite the content being rather complex in nature and requiring substantial investigation or field interviews.”</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The clients who are happiest with my work embrace my
       weird. They know I can inject creativity into their
       marketing. They want my ideas. They want my passion.
      </p>


      <h3>How can I get access to your services on demand?</h3>

      <p>If you need consistent help with copywriting, editing, and general marketing consulting, consider a monthly retainer. </p>

      <p>Retainer clients have access to me whenever they need help. This means if you contact me and need something right away, I’m there for you. </p>

      <p>My monthly retainer clients hire me for a certain number of hours per month, and get discounted hourly rates. </p>


      <h3>What types of companies do you work with? What topics?</h3>
      
      <p>I specialize in writing for B2B tech (often SaaS) and other
      varieties of growing startup and tech companies. When it comes
      to subject matter, I cover:
      </p>
      
      <ul>
	<li>Digital marketing insights and trends
	<li>Customer experience
	<li>Mobile marketing
	<li>Email marketing, social media, and SEO
	<li>Copywriting and content marketing
	<li>Freelance writing
	<li>Personal finance
	<li>Career insights and advice
	<li>Small business advice
	<li>Company culture and employee engagement
	<li>eCommerce tips and trends
      </ul>
      
      <p>I’m not limited to these areas– I also have experience with
      consumer-facing brands, healthcare, education and a few other
      industries. If you want specific samples, <a href="mailto: emma@storiesbyemma.co">hit me up</a>
